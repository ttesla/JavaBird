# Java Bird
A vertical shooter game made with Java.

This is my first proper playable game which have sprites, enemies, powerups and particles. It has a working vertical shooter base mechanic with a huge single level map. The worst part is, the level is hardcoded in the code. Thats the reason it doesn't have more levels to play. Most of the graphics are ripped from other games to be replaced later, some of the sprites are drawn by Metehan Alter. But there are still some sprites left unreplaced. You may still see some sprites from Metal Slug, Startcraft..ect. ;)  

Source is Netbeans project but have no dependency on the IDE, you may port it to Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA in no time.
